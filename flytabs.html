    <h1>FlyTabs - Mobile App</h1>
    <h5>UX Design Concept Project</h5>
    <p>People of all generations can attest that the world has never felt smaller than it does today. Not only are we inextricably linked through social media, our constant exposure to one another’s travel destinations inspire us to plan our next excursions with our favorite people. Having witnessed a multitude of ways that my peers and I plan individual as well as group travels, I saw the potential in designing a more streamlined and social process for organizing trips.</p>
  </div>

  <h5>GETTING STARTED</h5>
    <h1>Understand the Users</h1>
    <p>There are several widely-used travel search engines that are already efficient in planning one’s individual travels. With so many options available to everyone, I wanted to better understand how they approached finalizing a travel itinerary, which would clarify what problems they face in the process. I sent a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kRjZGDnVmkWXOjARejcfgh3lV3uPJ7EittVhv9pxw8I">survey</a> to 11 travel enthusiasts to learn the following: </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Find out how users search for flights and hotels.</li>
      <li>Compare ways that users save and share travel information with their group.</li>
      <li>Learn what users like about existing methods and what they wish could be improved.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="content2">
<div class="row">
<div class="container">
    <p>Much of the results regarding how the users typically booked trips were as I suspected. 9 out of 11 people surveyed usually plan trips with 2 or more people. Of those people 100% of respondents selected Facebook as their current preferred method for planning a group trip. However, given that Facebook is not a travel app, when asked what additional features they wished to see in a new tool on which to plan group travel, I received the following:</p>
    <!--<ul>
      <li>70% indicated they prioritize finding the lowest cost flights, being on the same flight if possible, and sharing the group travel itinerary.</li>
      <li>100% share the flight and hotel options with each other, all of which indicated Facebook as their preferred method of sharing</li>
      <li>89% want the option to organize trips by name within a travel app</li>
      <li>78% want the option to share flight and lodging search results with group members via email or social media</li>
      <li>78% want the option to enable in-app price tracking</li>
      <li>67% want the option of flight searches to display flexible dates</li>
    </ul>-->

When asked how each of them saves their preferred flight or hotel search results, I received many different answers:

<div class="container">
    <h1>Recognize the Problem</h1>
    <p>According to the survey results, while booking a trip for oneself was easy enough, doing so with a group is a cumbersome process. When my friends and I plan trips together, we share links that eventually became outdated, send screenshots that are out of context, and lose conversations that go off-topic and bury relevant trip details. Since everyone approaches the trip planning process differently, it became increasingly clear to me that the design challenge lied not with improving the booking process, but within the collaborative planning phase.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="content">

<div class="container">
<h5>THE RESEARCH</h5>
    <h1>Know the Target Market</h1>
    <p>In addition to analyzing the survey data, I interviewed my respondents so that they can elaborate on their specific needs. Along with the usual search engine attributes, users are eager for a travel app to offer the organizational and social aspects of FlyTabs to ease the group trip planning process. These are people who embrace social media platforms (like Facebook) and their group activity functions but require much more when it comes to planning travel. From here I proceeded to design a solution with these personas in mind. </p>

<div class="content2">
<div class="row">
<div class="container">
    <h1>Know the Competition</h1>
    <p>In terms of travel apps that offer both flight and hotel searches, Kayak, Expedia, TripAdvisor, and Skyscanner all lead the competitive space. Other apps such as TripAdvisor and Travefy help users create trip itineraries. My survey revealed that about 88% of my respondents use Google Flights to search flight options, and 75% use Airbnb to book lodging. Below is a comparison of major features they currently offer. <!--Read full competitive analysis <a href="comingsoon.html">here</a>.</p>-->
    <p>
    <img src="images/flytabs/competitive-analysis.png">
    </p>
    <p>These competitors are popular choices whose strengths lie within booking individual travels securely and efficiently. However, all of the above booking engines lack a convenient way to collaborate with friends when it comes to trip planning. When more people are involved in the trip, 100% percent of my respondents, testers, and I add in the use of Facebook to collaborate on planning. From personal experience, I found that organizing and discussing trip details pulled in from different search engines proved challenging.

<div class="container">
    <!--<h1>Define Our Purpose</h1>-->
    <p>So how do we prevent a huge mess when bringing all of this information together?  One tester mentioned how time consuming it is to try and share flights he found on Google Flights or Kayak. He explained, "When I want to share links to flights with my friends, sometimes I have to show them exactly what I've clicked to get there." My initial vision for FlyTabs was a travel app with the added convenience of Facebook Messenger integration to help users link directly to the content and discuss trip details. This was a start, but I needed to focus on creating a useful tool, not an app that added little value and a lot of noise, so I kept looking for ways to eliminate the challenges that we face.</p>

<div class="problem flytabs-solution">
<div class="row">
<div class="container">
  <h1>The Solution</h1>
  <p>Eventually it was evident that an app that merges the collaborative aspects of social media along with the search and book functionalities of popular search engines was the ideal solution. As shown in the survey data, the ability to better organize and consolidate all flight and hotel suggestions with their corresponding conversations, the option to enable price tracking and voting mechanisms, and a comprehensive view of the group’s travel itinerary are all desirable features of the ultimate group travel planner.</p>

<h5>BRANDING</h5>
<h1>Create the Look</h1>
<p>Since the purpose of this mobile app is to help users keep tabs on all planning activities concerning a particular trip, whether that’s turning on price tracking, seeing flights and hotels that group members have suggested and booked, or checking in on the group’s itinerary, I concluded the name "FlyTabs" suited the product. I envisioned an intuitive, casual, and comprehensive experience in which users can toggle through different tabs on the navigation to see all updated trip information displayed concisely.</p>
<p>To match the casual feel yet maximum functionality and focus that FlyTabs offers, I chose the sans-serif Roboto as the main typeface. As for the palette, I chose a monochromatic purple color scheme to give the experience a relaxed and friendly tone.</p>

<div class="content2">
<div class="row">
<div class="container">
<h1>The Logo</h1>
<p>FlyTabs' logo concept stemmed from the idea that FlyTabs encourages conversations revolving around a particular trip to stay within context of the item being discussed. I also wanted to convey that this app's abilities  will help maintain the group's spirit of exploration and excitement, and we can all forget about the stress and complexity of planning a group trip! After some <a href="images/flytabs/flytabs-mindmap.png" target="_blank">mind-mapping</a>, I designed the logo as seen below.</p>
<p><img class="medium" src="images/flytabs/flytabs-logo1.png"></p>
<p>A few preference tests and updates later, the final version of the FlyTabs logo was established!</p>

  <h5>DESIGNING THE EXPERIENCE</h5>
  <h1>User Flows and Site Map</h1>
  <p>With personas and user stories in mind, I mapped out the user flows for FlyTabs. From onboarding to creating a new trip to finalizing the travel itinerary, all steps were accounted for and prepped to create my first low-fidelity wireframes for FlyTabs.</p>

  <h1>Testing with Wireframes</h1>
  <p>Using Balsamiq, I designed low-fidelity wireframes for all user flows. I then created a clickable prototype using InvisionApp for my first round of usability testing. The purpose of testing early is to capture any areas of improvement before diving too deep into designing. I asked five testers to comment aloud as they went through several user flows prompted by a script I wrote for user testing.</p>

  <h1>Test 1 Results</h1>
  <p>From this initial round of testing, I discovered that the two tasks where people had the most issues were 1) finding where to save a flight or hotel to a trip and 2) commenting and joining the group trip conversation. Here's a breakdown of common struggles people had while completing each of the following scenarios:</p>
  <p class="bold">Scenario 1: Search for a flight, save it to your group trip (i.e. “Thanksgiving Cruise”), add a comment, and share with a friend via Facebook Messenger.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When attempting to save a flight search result to a group trip, 80% of testers ignored intended "Save" button (star icon), believing it symbolized “Favorite,” which can be interpreted to mean something completely different. Additionally, some users looked for the save option next to the other more obvious buttons such as “Book Now” and “Share,” rather than at the top right which they considered reserved for global buttons.</li>
      <li>Similarly, at which point the tester was prompted to add a comment to the group trip, users missed the comments icon at the top right. They either thought it was too obscure, thought it was a global chat button, or clicked on the group members’ icons hoping they would take them to the group conversation.</li>
    </ul>
<p class="bold">Scenario 2: Search for a hotel, save it to your group trip, add your vote, and book your reservation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For the most part, since the users went through similar steps during the flights flow, this went smoothly. Upon voting for a hotel suggestion, one user had slight trouble locating the votes, which were located on each specific hotel card. He believed it made more sense to see all suggestions people have made within the group trip, then be able to vote.</li>
  </ul>
<p class="bold">Scenario 3: View the group’s trip itinerary. Sign out.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The users were able to locate the itinerary easily. One tester took longer as he did not see the dropdown suggesting the “See All” reservations view.</li>
  </ul>

<h5>CHALLENGES AND PIVOTS</h5>
<h1>Testing with the Prototype</h1>
<p>This first usability test was crucial in helping me rethink some of the solutions to the fundamental problems I’m trying to solve in FlyTabs. I updated the points of entry into “My Trips” so that the user may “Create a Trip” the moment he or she logs in, rather than create or save to a trip after searching for the flight or hotel. However, while “Save to Trip” was easy enough to fix, the “comments” section had me thinking of a new direction in terms of how to facilitate the group conversation better. The feedback I received from my testers ranged from the icon being obscure to the display of the comments complicating the group conversation. I wanted to remove any additional navigation required to view comments or messages posted in reference to any flight or hotel suggested within the group. </p>

<p>With these changes implemented and branding complete, I created the high-fidelity mockup in Sketch and a clickable prototype using Invision. Give it a test run <a href="https://invis.io/H89624676">here!</a></p>

<h1>Keep Talking</h1>
<p>The most challenging part of this project was designing the best interface for the conversational aspect of this trip planning app. Originally, with the emergence of iOS messaging allowing apps like Evernote to feature message integration, I saw FlyTabs adopting the same function as the main way people can collaborate, especially since most people already use Facebook or Facebook Messenger. Through multiple rounds of testing however, users eventually made evident that an in-app commenting system was the optimal approach, removing the need to jump between apps and break up the conversation. Shown here is the evolution of the social aspect of FlyTabs:</p>
<!-- flat images -->
<p><b>Version 1:</b> This started with a comment section on each particular flight or hotel page. Users are able to share flight details outside of FlyTabs, which is where message integration would take place. This experienced lacked a sense of unity as users would be forced to click into each flight or hotel card to see the conversation or jump over to their messaging app.
<img class="medium" src="images/flytabs/comments-v1.png"></p>


<p><b>Version 2:</b> My testers and I tried out a global chatbox, allowing “tagging” of flights or hotels within the chat bubble so group members can directly access the full details page. After observing how people respond to a group chat versus commenting threads, I realized this format meant endless scrolling for information, which did not help organize the conversation.
<img class="medium" src="images/flytabs/comment-v2.png"></p>

<p><b>Version 3:</b> Next we tried adding a tab for a global commenting section for a particular trip. By making posts static, I imagined the possibility of collapsing or filtering the comments by flight or hotel. However, after testing and discussing with some software engineers, we concluded that altough a sophisticated approach, an unfamiliar interface may not appeal to the typical user.
<img class="medium" src="images/flytabs/comment-v3.png"></p>

<p><b>Version 4:</b> Finally, after learning something new from each iteration, I settled with the collapsible comments attached to each flight or hotel card. This way users are encouraged to stay on topic while discussing their options. With every action associated under the appropriate tab within the group trip page, the entire experience of saving, voting, and commenting feels more unified.

<h1>Test 2 Results</h1>
<p>Fortunately, after several iterations for sections that received the most feedback during the low-fidelity wireframe user testing, FlyTabs took form of the high-fidelity clickable prototype seen <a href="https://invis.io/H89624676">here.</a></p>
<p>With all updates implemented I guided a group of testers through the second round of usability tests. Fortunately, results show that the flow of previously tested scenarios such as creating a trip, saving a flight or hotel, and commenting on the group trip improved immensely since the low-fidelity wireframes. The positive reinforcement I received in terms of the intuitiveness, usability, and improvements made upon previous versions when it came to the key features that my target market was looking for in a group travel app helped shape what the product has become today and even what we might look forward to in the future.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>FlyTabs addresses the fundemental goals of users like myself who want the most efficient experience in planning a group trip. With the number of iterations it took to design the conversational feature of the app, I learned about the value of balancing between addressing my own frustrations and creating the minimum viable product that would ultimately speak to the goals of the entire target market.</p>
<p>If I could take this passion project even further into development, I can see other areas with potential which I discussed with users after testing completed. Judging by comments made throughout testing, simplifying the experience even more by merging the "Home" and "My Trips" page is another way to minimize the points of entry to the user's saved trips. Furthermore, the ability to see an individual group member's travel itinerary could also be helpful. Finally, as the high majority of survey respondents selected Airbnb as their preferred search engine for hotels or lodging, I can see FlyTabs exploring the possibility of partnering with Airbnb to appeal to all audiences.
