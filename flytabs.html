    <h1>FlyTabs - Mobile App</h1>
    <h5>UX Design Concept Project</h5>
    <p>People of all generations can attest that the world has never felt smaller than it does today. Not only are we inextricably linked through social media, our constant exposure to one another’s travel destinations inspire us to plan our next excursions with our favorite people. Having witnessed a multitude of ways that my peers and I plan individual as well as group travels, I saw the potential in designing a more streamlined and social process for organizing trips.</p>

  <h5>GETTING STARTED</h5>
    <h1>Understand the Users</h1>
    <p>There are several widely-used travel search engines that are already efficient in planning one’s individual travels. With so many options available to everyone, I wanted to better understand how they approached finalizing a travel itinerary, which would clarify what problems they face in the process. I sent a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kRjZGDnVmkWXOjARejcfgh3lV3uPJ7EittVhv9pxw8I">survey</a> to 11 travel enthusiasts to learn the following: </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Find out how users search for flights and hotels.</li>
      <li>Compare ways that users save and share travel information with their group.</li>
      <li>Learn what users like about existing methods and what they wish could be improved.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="content2">
<div class="row">
<div class="container">
    <p>Much of the results regarding how the users typically booked trips were as I suspected. 9 out of 11 people surveyed usually plan trips with 2 or more people. Of those people 100% of respondents selected Facebook as their current preferred method for planning a group trip. However, when asked what additional features they wished to see in a new group travel planning app, I received the following:</p>
    <!--<ul>
      <li>70% indicated they prioritize finding the lowest cost flights, being on the same flight if possible, and sharing the group travel itinerary.</li>
      <li>100% share the flight and hotel options with each other, all of which indicated Facebook as their preferred method of sharing</li>
      <li>89% want the option to organize trips by name within a travel app</li>
      <li>78% want the option to share flight and lodging search results with group members via email or social media</li>
      <li>78% want the option to enable in-app price tracking</li>
      <li>67% want the option of flight searches to display flexible dates</li>
    </ul>-->

<h5>THE CHALLENGES</h5>
When asked how each of them saves their preferred flight or hotel search results, I received many different answers:
<p>
 <!-- <div class="three columns quotes">
    <p>"...bookmark it"</p>
    <p>"...e-mail the link to myself"</p>
    <p>"...take a screenshot"</p>
  </div>
  <div class="three columns quotes">
    <p>"...copy and paste the link to my notes app"</p>
    <p>"...keep the tab open on my browser"</p>
  </div>
  <div class="three columns quotes">
    <p>"...favorite the search result on the website"</p>
    <p>"...post the link to the Facebook group"</p>
  </div>
-->
    <ul style="list-style: none;" class="quotes">
      <li>"...bookmark it"</li>
      <li>"...e-mail the link to myself"</li>
      <li>"...take a screenshot"</li>

      <li>"...favorite the search result on the website"</li>
      <li>"...post the link to the Facebook group"</li>
    </ul>
<p>Surely there must be a better way!</p>

<div class="container">
    <h1>Recognize the Problem</h1>
    <p>According to the survey results, while booking a trip for oneself was easy enough, doing so with a group is a cumbersome process. When my friends and I plan trips together, we share links that eventually became outdated, send screenshots that are out of context, and lose conversations that go off-topic and bury relevant trip details. Since everyone approaches the trip planning process differently, it became increasingly clear to me that the design challenge lied not with improving the booking process, but within the collaborative planning phase.</p>

<h5>THE RESEARCH</h5>
    <h1>Know the Target Market</h1>
    <p>In addition to analyzing the survey data, I interviewed my respondents so that they can elaborate on their specific needs. Along with the usual search engine attributes, users are eager for a travel app to offer the organizational and social aspects of FlyTabs to ease the group trip planning process. These are people who embrace social media platforms (like Facebook) and their group activity functions but require much more when it comes to planning travel. From here I proceeded to design a solution with these personas in mind. </p>

<div class="content2">

<div class="container">
    <h1>Know the Competition</h1>
    <p>In terms of travel apps that offer both flight and hotel searches, Kayak, Expedia, TripAdvisor, and Skyscanner all lead the competitive space. Other apps such as TripAdvisor and Travefy help users create trip itineraries. My survey revealed that about 88% of my respondents use Google Flights to search flight options, and 75% use Airbnb to book lodging. Below is a comparison of major features they currently offer. <!--Read full competitive analysis <a href="comingsoon.html">here</a>.</p>-->
    <p>
    <img src="images/flytabs/competitive-analysis.png">
    </p>
    <p>These competitors are popular choices that get the job done when booking individual travels. However, when more people are involved in the trip, 100% percent of my respondents, testers, and I add in the use of Facebook to collaborate on planning. My initial vision for FlyTabs was a new tool that maintained all functions of a typical travel app - search, save, and book flights and hotels - with the added convenience of Facebook Messenger integration to help users discuss trip details. This was a good start, but we wanted more. From personal experience, I found that organizing and discussing trip details pulled in from different search engines proved challenging.

    <h1>Define Our Purpose</h1>
    <p>So how do we prevent a huge mess when bringing all of this information together? We needed a useful tool, not an app that added little value and a lot of noise, so I kept looking for ways to eliminate the challenges that we face. One tester mentioned how time consuming it is to try and share flights he found on Google Flights or Kayak. He explained, "When I want to share links to flights with my friends, sometimes I have to show them exactly what I've clicked to get there." A travel app that saves, books, allows conversation in context, and shows the entire group's travel itinerary all in one place would address all of these frustrations and needs.</p>

<div class="container">
  <h1>The Solution</h1>
  <p>Eventually it was evident that an app that merges the collaborative aspects of social media along with the search and book functionalities of popular search engines was the ideal solution. As shown in the survey data, the ability to better organize and consolidate all flight and hotel suggestions with their corresponding conversations, the option to enable price tracking and voting mechanisms, and a comprehensive view of the group’s travel itinerary are all desirable features of a new tool that eases group travel planning.</p>

<h5>BRANDING AND DESIGN</h5>
<p>Since the purpose of this mobile app is to help users keep tabs on all planning activities concerning a particular trip, whether that’s turning on price tracking, seeing flights and hotels that group members have suggested and booked, or checking in on the group’s itinerary, I concluded the name "FlyTabs" suited the product. I envisioned an intuitive, casual, and comprehensive experience in which users can toggle through different tabs on the navigation to see all updated trip information displayed concisely.</p>

<h1>Create the Logo</h1>
<p>The logo concept stemmed from the idea that FlyTabs encourages conversations revolving around a particular trip to stay within context of the item being discussed. I also wanted to convey that this app's abilities  will help maintain the group's spirit of exploration and excitement, and we can all forget about the stress and complexity of planning a group trip! After some <a href="images/flytabs/flytabs-mindmap.png" target="_blank">mind-mapping</a> and settling with a monochromatic purple color scheme to give the experience a relaxed and friendly tone, I designed the logo as seen below.</p>
<p><img src="images/flytabs/flytabs-logo1.png"></p>
<p>A few preference tests and updates later, the final version of the FlyTabs logo was established!</p>

  <h1>Design the Experience</h1>
  <p>With personas and user stories in mind, I mapped out the user flows and site map for FlyTabs. From onboarding to creating a new trip to finalizing the travel itinerary, all steps were accounted for and prepped to create my first low-fidelity wireframes for FlyTabs.</p>
