        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        If you have ever shopped for travel on sites like Expedia, you may have come across some version of the following product in the past. With an interface resembling quite literally 2 browser tabs placed to each other, it allows the user to compare rates between two travel sites in one window to assist with comparison shopping - something that almost all of our users have reported doing when shopping for flights and hotels. I'll call it <b>Comparison Shopper</b>.

    <img src="images/comparison-shopper/tab-compare.png">
    <p class="image-captions">The original Comparison Shopper allows users to compare travel rates (e.g. flights, hotels, and cars) from 2 sites in a single window.</p>
    <br>
        Comparison Shopper presents itself to a travel site visitor who is leaving the site, capturing otherwise bouncing traffic by advertising alternative flight, hotel, and car rental options. For this product update at Intent, a data science company that partners with a global network of leading travel sites, we wanted to revamp its intuitiveness and end user experience.

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        We conducted several usability tests to gather data on how to improve Comparison Shopper and learned that 50% of them associated the experience with an ad; some shrewdly called it “targeted advertising” or a “cart abandonment tactic.” Despite this assumption, most found the experience useful because it featured sites they were familiar with, with their most recent search (e.g. hotels in Las Vegas) already populated on the featured sites.
        <img style="max-width: 500px;" src="images/comparison-shopper/TC-qualdata-1.png">
        When it came to desired functionality and basic usability, however, we observed many pain points below:
        <ol class="default-bullets"> 
            <li>“The content is a little small...would prefer one screen.”</li>
            <li>“I can't choose a different site?”</li>
            <li>“It’s a time saver, but there’s a lot of info so it’s hard to read.”</li>
            <li>“Too busy, too much going on at one time...if you know what you’re looking for it’s not useful, just noise.”</li>
            <li>“It’s annoying to have to enter dates on every site,”</li>
        </ol>
        
        <br>
        In one session, the user did not even realize there were two different sites displayed, which we predicted was due to the current lack of visual separation between the two sites. These were all crucial pieces of feedback we referenced to brainstorm a more user-focused, sleeker comparison tool that eases the travel shopping experience, boosts interaction rate, and ultimately lifts conversion rates for our partners.

        <h3>Ideation</h3>
       	One business requirement was maintaining ability for multiple advertiser sites to be displayed in one browsing session, as the more sites rendered, the more revenue generated. Some user insights were helpful in brainstorming the new design direction for Comparison Shopper while fulfilling this requirement. Specifically, we needed to steer clear from anything that resembled our target user’s ultimate nightmare - something that they brought up repeatedly as a top frustration while visiting some e-commerce websites:
        <img style="max-width: 720px;" src="images/comparison-shopper/popups-galore.png">
        <p class="image-captions">Look familiar? Stacks of popups opening to an unsuspecting travel site visitor...no thanks!</p>
        <br>
       Yet, while a high percentage of users felt this strong aversion toward popups and ads in general, most people’s "magic wand" wish for the optimal shopping experience was still the ability to view all the best deals across sites in one place, so we needed to reconcile these somehow. At this point we hypothesized the following solution to address our users’ priorities in a comparison shopping experience without accidentally reminding them of cringey popups.

    <div class="container">
        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        A more customizable Comparison Shopper with added utility including the ability to change search intents, select preferred brands, and the toggle the number of sites in view will lead to higher interaction rate and improved monetization.

        <h3>Designing The Experience</h3>
        A few days of rapid iterative design and several usability testing sessions later, we created a new and improved Comparison Shopper unit. Two major functional improvements we made here were the editable search form and ability to choose which sites to focus on. 
        <img src="images/comparison-shopper/dyo-demo.gif">
        <p class="image-captions">Our redesigned Comparison Shopper now takes the form of a dynamic set of panes that load advertisers according to what the user selects.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition to the added ability to swap in and out both the number of sites and the brands they wished to compare, we used separate panes to visually differentiate multiple sites being rendered in one window. Checkboxes, logos, and enticingly clickable cells promote comparison shopping utility. We also enabled retrievability and seamless ability to compare up to 4 sites at a time. Finally, we used new transition animations to cue hierarchy, functionality, and trustworthiness.
        <p>
        After testing this new design, user feedback validated our choices, and we were deeply satisfied with the significant improvement over the initial feedback we received on the original design:
        
        <ol class="default-bullets"> 
            <li>“I like this a lot actually...can quickly understand the functionality”</li>
            <li>"...easy to enter my dates once and do a process of elimination to find the most relevant deal.”</li>
            <li>“I feel confident choosing a good hotel because I can see all the sites upfront."</li>
            <li>“...it’s exactly what I want.”</li>
        </ol>
      
    </div>
</div>

<div class="projects3">
    <div class="container">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        The new and improved Comparison Shopper is currently live on select online travel agencies and vacation rental sites. While it was a challenge to design a simple UI that intuitively presented a ton of information and provided customizability all at once, performance metrics show a substantial boost in interaction rate that has led to a 50% improvement in monetization! 
        <br>
        <br>
        We won’t stop here however. We’re currently testing a feature that allows the user to toggle between “Focus mode” and “Compare mode,” cutting down the steps required for someone to view one advertiser’s site at a time or multiple sites at a time. Stay tuned for more developments on our beloved comparison shopping assistant!
