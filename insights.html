           <h4>Dashboard UI/UX</h4>
           <h1>Insights Dashboard</h1>
           At the data science company where I work, we noticed the growing need to build a visual front-end to showcase the technology behind our real-time predictive analytics for ecommerce. As a result the idea of a new dashboard experience was born. As lead designer I owned research and design as well as implemented the HTML/CSS front-end of our new enterprise-level SaaS analytics platform, working closely with data scientists to visualize complex machine learning concepts in an intuitive way.</span>

        <h4>Getting Started</h4> 
        <h3>Researching The Problem</h3>
       Our team (a PM, engineer, and myself) - began the research phase by interviewing client strategy managers, data scientists, and optimization managers to fully understand the process currently in place for pitching data insights and integrating a partner to our machine learning platform. We learned that it was an extremely manual, cross-functional effort that involved a ton of hand-holding and back and forth communication, so this process was clearly unscalable if the company hoped to reach many more ecommerce prospects more efficiently.

        <p class="pullout-quotes">We lacked the visual front-end for educating and integrating partners on our machine learning platform, making the process for sharing data insights and recommendations unscalable.</p>

       To reiterate, the main pain points we had to solve for were as follows:

        <ul class="default-bullets">
            <li>Our partner-facing teams needed a visual, comprehensive educational device for proving the value of our predictive intelligence technology to partner prospects.</li>
            <li>Creating custom data insights and pitch decks was a tedious, cross-functional effort.</li>
            <li>Partner onboarding, site integration, and exposure to additional applications were not scalable processes.</li>
            <li>We lacked a place for future beta products to be tested and discovered by users.</li>
        </ul>

        With these product requirements in mind we defined our objective for building an MVP under a time constraint and began sketching out some possible dashboard layouts.

        <p class="image-captions">Initial sketches looked a little something like this. </p>

        <h3>The Objective</h3>
        Our goal was to create an interactive front-end experience for our predictive analytics platform. We needed a way to onboard a partner seamlessly, showcase our data insights in an intuitive way, and recommend applications based on the partner’s own data. Recognizing that this product has the potential to strengthen existing relationships as well as open conversations with untapped markets, my team proposed an analytics dashboard as our MVP, which I will call <b>Insights</b>.

        <h4>Designing The Experience</h4>
        <h3>User Flow and Wireframes</h3>
        We started with mapping out primary user flows that we would build for our beta product. From onboarding a partner as a new user, to giving updated recommendations through a curated progressive learning UX - we worked closely with partner-facing colleagues for designing this end-to-end experience.

    <div class="six columns">
        <h3>Design Direction: Option B</h3>
        I wireframed 2 options to consider for our design direction. Option A is a vertical layout displaying multiple graphs on the same page. Option B looked more like a single-page app, with one graph per view. Upon receiving feedback we decided on <b>Option B</b> for several reasons:
        <ul class="default-bullets">
            <li>A single-page app format minimizes clutter so users can focus on one insight at a time along with relevant key takeaways.</li>
            <li>There’s more real estate for this tool to teach complex machine learning concepts to a new user.</li>
            <li>A more prominent CTA provides guidance for next steps.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h4>Rapid Iterative Design</h4>
        <h3>Building + Testing: The Dashboard</h3>
        To build our MVP from scratch and get it ready for testing as quickly as possible, our engineer and I collaborated closely via a shared workflow (which involved my learning git) so that I can contribute to the front-end HTML/CSS. We tag-teamed the development of a functioning prototype, pulling real data into the graphs, and before long were ready for usability testing!

        <br><br> 
        Since we were developing a product with limited access to end user input (due to strict business constraints), we got creative with our usability testing strategy. Our colleagues in business development and client strategy management had frequent access to the needs and feedback of our partners, so they became our proxy users in our usability testing sessions. Our prompt for the user was: <i>Log into Insights to view up-to-date data analyses generated for your site. Interact with the site to learn more, and inquire about next steps.</i>

        <br><br> 
        Below are some usability testing results for just one page of the dashboard.

        <p class="image-captions">Version 1: While intuitive, the takeaways and CTA were not engaging enough.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="six columns">
        <h3>Version 1</h3>
        All users discovered organically that they can hover over the curves for more context. 80% of users clicked “Recommendation” to learn more about next steps. We were on the right path to designing an intuitive and educational dashboard UX, but some frustrations we needed to address were:
        <ol class="default-bullets">
            <li>“The [blue] tidbit and contextual information are not noticeable enough.”</li>
            <li>“How would a new user know how to use this [graph]?”</li>
            <li>Regarding some elements falling below the fold (indicated by the dashed line): “...would be nice to have everything in one view and eliminate scrolling”</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="six columns">
        <img src="images/insights/insights-v2.png">
    </div>
    <div class="six columns">
        <h3>Version 2: Final Design</h3>
        In V2 we rearranged the layout so that anytime the user hovered on any region of the graph, corresponding insights would appear dynamically to the right. 
        <ol class="default-bullets">
            <li>Tidbits were relocated to display directly inside the graph area to add context.</li>
            <li>A tutorial for the various interactions available was added to teach new users how to read their insights.</li>
            <li>To reduce scrolling, critical information and calls to action are now placed above the fold.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h3>More Finalized Flows: Onboarding</h3>
        Self-service onboarding is now <a href="https://insights.intent.com/">live on our website</a> and allows partners to sign up for access to Insights. We ask basic questions to kick off the site integration process and start training data science models. Now:
        <ul class="default-bullets">
            <li>The process of screening prospective partners and onboarding is a lot more scalable.</li>
            <li>The questionnaire eliminates excessive back-and-forth communications.</li>
            <li>Partners can now sign into Insights anytime to check up on performance data and learn about our products within the context of their own site data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Result</h4> 
        <h3>Insights Dashboard - Now Live</h3>
        After a several rounds of design iterations and development, we launched the dashboard exerience for a group of beta testing partners to continue gathering feedback from end users. We're thrilled about the positive impact we have made judging by comments from partner-facing teams, and the more feedback we receive, the more we can ideate on new graphs and features to build. The possiblities are endless now that both prospective and existing partners can sign up to access Insights, and unlock the potential value that our machine learning platform can bring.
