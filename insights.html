                <h1>Insights Dashboard</h1>
                At our data science company, there was a business need to build a visual front end for our machine learning platform where ecommerce partners can view data insights and product recommendations in a scalable way. As lead designer I owned research and design as well as implemented the HTML/CSS front-end of our dashboard experience.

        <h3>Researching The Problem</h3>
        We held discovery interviews with stakeholders and key users - account managers, data scientists, and optimization managers - to understand the current process for pitching data insights and integrating a partner to our machine learning platform. Most of the internal and external user pain points and needs fell within the following 3 processes:

            <li>Our business dev. teams were sharing performance metrics in unsophisticated slide format.</li>
            <li>Prospect screening then site onboarding were not a scalable process.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Internally, we lacked a place for future beta insights to be tested and discovered by users.</li>

        <h3>The Objective</h3>
        Our goal was to create an interactive front-end experience for our predictive analytics platform. We needed a way to onboard a partner seamlessly, showcase our data insights in an intuitive way, and recommend applications based on the partner’s own data. If we look further out in time, we recognized the potential for the product to strengthen existing relationships as well as open conversations with untapped markets.

        <h3>Designing The Experience</h3>
        During ideation we asked ourselves, <i>“How might we create a visual front-end for educating and integrating partners on our machine learning platform, streamlining the process for sharing data insights and product recommendations?”</i> The winning proposal was a dashboard experience for our MVP.
        <br>
        <br>
        From onboarding a partner as a new user, to giving updated recommendations through a curated progressive learning UX - we worked closely with partner-facing colleagues for designing the <a href="images/insights/Insights-user-flow.png" target="_blank">user flow</a> and wireframes for this end-to-end experience.

    <div class="six columns">
        <h5>Wireframing The Design Direction</h5>
        <p>
        Upon receiving feedback I recommended <b>Option B</b> for several reasons:
        <ul class="default-bullets">
            <li>A single-page app format minimizes clutter so users can focus on one insight at a time along with relevant key takeaways.</li>
            <li>There’s more real estate for this tool to teach complex machine learning concepts to a new user.</li>
            <li>A more prominent CTA provides guidance for next steps.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="projects1">
    <div class="container" style="padding-bottom: 0px;">
        <h3>Usability Testing: The Dashboard</h3>
        Since we had limited access to external user input (due to strict business constraints) and our partner-facing teams had frequent access to the needs and feedback of our partners, they became our proxy users in our initial usability testing sessions. Our prompt for the user was: <b>Visit Insights to view up-to-date data analyses generated for your site. Interact with the site to learn more, and inquire about next steps.</b>

        <p>
        Below are some usability testing results (n=10) for just one page of the dashboard.

    </div>
    <div class="six columns">
        <h5>Version 1</h5>
        <p>
        All users discovered organically that they can hover over the curves for more context. 80% of users knew how to learn more about next steps. Some frustrations we observed were:
        <ol class="default-bullets">
            <li>“The [blue] tidbit and contextual information are not noticeable enough.”</li>
            <li>“How would a new user know how to use this [additional layer]?”</li>
            <li>Regarding some elements falling below the fold: “...would be nice to have everything in one view and eliminate scrolling”</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="splitscreen2" style="background-color: #ffffff;">
    <div class="six columns">
        <img src="images/insights/insights-v2.png">
    </div>
    <div class="six columns">
        <h5>Version 2</h5>
        <p>
        In the final design, we rearranged the layout to implement these design changes:
        <ol class="default-bullets">
            <li>Tidbits were relocated to display directly inside the graph area to add context.</li>
            <li>A tutorial for the various interactions available was added to teach new users how to read their insights.</li>
            <li>To reduce scrolling, critical information and calls to action are now placed above the fold.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

        <h3>The Result</h3>
        To build our MVP from scratch and get it ready for testing as quickly as possible, our engineer and I collaborated closely via a shared workflow (which involved my learning git) so that I can contribute to the front-end HTML/CSS. After several rounds of design iterations and development, we launched the dashboard experience for a group of beta testing partners to continue gathering feedback from internal as well as external users! Here’s how we addressed the inefficiencies previously mentioned.

            <p><b>1. Data-led pitches + onboarding</b></p>
        </div>
        <p>Demo-ing insights and metrics with polished design and easy interactive features improved the effectiveness of pitches and strengthened our offering. Now that we have self-service onboarding LIVE, “the vision to go from integrating 10-20 sites per month to 100s per month” seems possible!

            <p><b>2. Generate + share data insights</b></p>
        </div>
        <p>The process of reviewing site models and pulling insights for partners was completely automated, plus internal and external users can now access this on their own. According to optimization managers, the dashboard made data validation 50% faster,  “easily ~20 min. of work was reduced to just checking the dashboard to see we had the right traffic distribution.”

            <p><b>3. New product discovery</b></p>
        </div>
        <p>The process of pulling materials for partners in order to upsell or introduce new products was streamlined. Beta testing “partners love it because they could grasp the data at their own speed, if e.g. they didn’t get it right away in the meeting.” Partners can log in anytime to read up on our product offering or check for more insights.

        <h3>Insights Dashboard - Now Live</h3>
        <!--<img src="images/insights/insights-dashboard.gif">-->
        
        Self-service onboarding is now <a href="https://www.intent.com" target="_blank">live</a> on our website and allows partners to sign up for access to Insights. We’re in the process of onboarding more sites, meanwhile I'm collaborating closely with data scientists + optimization managers to translate additional complex machine learning concepts to interactive experiences that are intuitive and educational.
