                <h1>Mobile Map Meta</h1>
                As part of the mobile UX initiative at the ad tech + data science company where I work, we solved for increasing bookings on mobile devices within the online travel industry, where conversion rates continue to be much lower than that of desktop. We chose a map interface to provide users with the optimal hotel comparison shopping experience.

        <h3>User Research - Booking Hotels</h3>
        We interviewed 25 users about their typical travel booking process and learned that most of them do some sort of comparison shopping. We also found out their top 3 priorities while researching hotels:
        <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Priorities</th>
                <th>% of Respondents</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Location of the hotel</td>
                <td>65</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Price per night</td>
                <td>30</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Aesthetics (photos)</td>
                <td>17</td>
            </tr>
            
        </tbody>
        
    </table>




        Next, we found out what their top frustration was while booking hotels (or travel in general) on mobile, and the overwhelming majority said: <b>"The screen size is too small for comparing prices and options."</b> This research helped us zone in on the objective of this project during our ideation session, which included the designers, engineers, and product manager.

        <h3>The Objective</h3>
       	Some of our users face analysis paralysis from comparing too many options during their hotel search, and this is even more frustrating on a small screen. With the help of our network-wide data, we hypothesized that users are less interested in comparing multiple hotel sites and instead want to be guided directly to the right hotel that meets their preferences. 
        <br><br>
        We decided our objective was to create a product to help the user decide where they want to stay by narrowing options as quickly and efficiently as possible. This balanced meeting both the user need and business goal of boosting conversions on mobile for our travel site partners.

        <h3>Ideation + Wireframes</h3>
        The main output for our ideation session was defining the MVP. In order to test early, we scoped this project to the top 10 most-searched cities for V1. Given that according to our user research, the top priority for choosing a hotel was location, we decided to create a mobile meta search site with a map interface and nick-named it <b>Map Meta</b>.

        <h3>Rapid Iterative Design</h3>
        In true Lean UX fashion we tested often and applied rapid iterative design. We invited users nearly every day to usability test our <a href="https://invis.io/9SNQ1IPMBFT#/278358251_B1_Best_Value_Hotel2" target="_blank">prototype</a>. A few iterations later, our Map Meta site was ready to be released for live split testing on several of our partner sites.

        <h3>Map Meta - Now Live</h3>
        This Map Meta ad unit is currently live on select hotel and vacation rental sites. The map presents itself whenever our predictive analytics categorizes a site visitor as unlikely to book in the current browsing session, thus capturing otherwise bouncing traffic by advertising alternative hotel options offered by other travel sites in our network. Thus, not only are we providing a utility for mobile site users looking to book the right hotel, we're adhering to the business goal of driving more mobile traffic and conversions to our partners.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        Early numbers suggest that this has been well-received by site visitors, with an interaction rate (synonymous to click-through rate, or clicks over number of times the our map rendered) of ~21%, one of the highest interaction rates across our network, and performing 25% better than our previous hotel product.
        <br><br>
        Our team will continue to monitor these numbers and improve usability with each iteration. Next steps include adding more functionality and customizability within the search form and eventually supporting all destinations when Map Meta is productized and offered to our global network of travel sites.
