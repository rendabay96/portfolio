                        The Okta Active Directory (AD) agent allows customers to integrate their AD with Okta for all of their workforce identity needs (e.g. employee lifecycle management). We discovered that most of our customers were using outdated Okta agents, which can lead to costly problems. I partnered with product, engineering, and research to investigate how we might incentivize users to keep their agents up-to-date.

        <h3>Case study: Coming soon</h3>
        The new and improved Okta agent update process features automated agent updates on-demand or on a predetermined schedule. Since going live, not only have our analytics shown early success in feature adoption, some customers have reached out with glowing reviews on how it addressed previous painpoints and improved their workflows immensely.

        Stay tuned for the complete case study!

        In order to update an AD agent, the admin needs to download the new agent and go through ~22 steps between the host Windows machine and web browser to install the new version. While users knew that by keeping agents up-to-date, they'll benefit from bug fixes and new features as well as migrate from versions that are no longer supported, our users were not proactively updating and even often wait until an Okta customer success manager has prompted them to update. Simplifying this process to a one-click solution (internally referred to as agent auto-update) was already on the roadmap, but the insights we gathered from our user interviews told us that their struggles went beyond the tediousness; things were more complicated than that. We interviewed N IT admins who maintain their Active Directory integations with Okta and gained the following telling insights as to why that is:

        <h3>The Objective</h3>
          From our research findings we synthesized that our users were constantly putting off updating their agents until the last possible moment. So we knew our solution had to address this. We asked ourselves, how might we incentivize admins to proactively keep their agents up-to-date? How might we gain their trust in the agent auto-update feature?
