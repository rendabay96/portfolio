                        The Okta Active Directory (AD) agent allows customers to integrate their AD with Okta for all of their workforce identity needs (e.g. employee lifecycle management). We discovered that most of our customers were using outdated Okta agents, which can lead to costly problems.

        <!--<h3>Case study: Coming soon</h3>
        The new and improved Okta agent update process features automated agent updates on-demand or on a predetermined schedule. Since going live, not only have our analytics shown early success in feature adoption, some customers have reached out with glowing reviews on how it addressed previous painpoints and improved their workflows immensely.
        <br><br>
        Stay tuned for the complete case study!

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        When an IT administrator of an organization integrates their Active Directory (AD) with Okta to enable employees with single sign-on for app access or to manage their user profile and lifecycle changes, they must first install one lightweight agent per AD instance which runs on the Windows host machine and keeps all changes between AD and Okta synchronized. Admins are instructed to keep these agents up-to-date as new versions containing bug fixes and new features are released.

        </a>
        <p class="image-captions">Diagram of an Okta + AD integration. Many customers were operating on outdated AD agents.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Unfortunately, we discovered that the majority of our admins were <b>not</b> proactively updating their agents and would often wait until an Okta customer success manager prompts them to do so. We predicted it was due to the extremely manual process, but there were much more complicated reasons. My team and I set out to investigate how we might improve the Okta AD agent update workflow so that our users were not missing out on new functionalities.

        <h3>Researching The Problem</h3>
            My team and I had uncovered a popular feature request (275+ upvotes) from Okta's customer forum implying that reducing the steps to updating agents would already help immensely. However, the data we gathered from user interviews (n = 5) told us that their frustrations went beyond just the tedious agent update process.

        <br><br>
        <p>My research partner and I synthesized our raw interview notes and shared the the following key insights with PMs, engineers, and architects to align everyone as we began discussing opportunities for UX improvement:</p>

            <div class="project-table-right">
                <b>1.) Updating AD agents to the latest version is extremely manual and time-consuming, so most admins update only 1-2x per year.</b>
                <p>Today, admins have to download the new agent onto the Windows host machine (which may not be where the admin works day-to-day), and go through ~22 steps between the host machine and web browser to install it. Many users manage multiple AD domains and 15+ agents per domain, requiring days to weeks to complete.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="project-table problems">

                <b>2.) Admins are wary of new agent versions as they lack the visibility they need to troubleshoot when things go wrong.</b>
                <p>At the moment, if an update fails, the admin digs through various system logs and reports to troubleshoot. To mitigate possible faulty agent installations, admins have gone into the habit of testing new versions in a preview environment prior to installing in production, which doubles the manual work required. </p>

            <div class="project-table-right">
                <b>3.) Though it requires more planning, admins intentionally update agents one by one for redundancy.</b>
                <p>Generally the "primary" agent of an AD instance is updated first, then users move onto the next one. Their end users are constantly logging into Okta, so if something goes wrong and all the agents are offline during an update, user access is blocked. Thus admins spend time and effort planning the downtime required for agents to be updated.</p>

        <h3>The Objective</h3>
        Our users were struggling to monitor and update their Okta AD agents in timely manner, even at times putting off the task until the last possible moment when an Okta customer-facing employee had to get involved. So our solution had to do more than just address current UI issues that made this difficult - we asked ourselves, how might we incentivize admins to proactively keep their agents up-to-date, as well as regain their trust in the agent update process moving forward.

        <h3>Design Direction</h3>
       
         <b>Business constraints:</b>
         <p>As is the case for all enterprise-level design, we couldn't forget about the business and tech contraints. While workshopping concepts with PMs, engineers, and architects, we aligned on the following main constraints:
            <ol class="default-bullets"> 
                <li>"Agent auto-update" (as we began to call it) will only be supported by the next released version of the Okta AD agent. This meant our users must first go through the manual process one last time to enable the new features moving forward.</li>
                <li>At the time of developing this feature, the Okta admin UI was undergoing a complete redesign. Because the new design system would not be ready by the time our engineers would build the feature, I had to use existing components of the legacy design system as much as possible, while ensuring their styles were compatible with the future design system.</li>
            </ol>
        <br>
        <b>Hypothesis:</b>
        <p>If we provide more visibility into AD agent statuses and guide users toward enabling automatic updates, then users will update their agents in a timely manner because of the added incentive of a much easier experience moving forward.
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>User flows:</b>
            <p>In collaboration with my cross-functional team, I mapped out the primary user flows in scope for our MVP:</p>
     
            <a class="example-image-link" href="images/agents/user flow - agent auto-update.png" data-lightbox="example-1">

                <!--<li>As an admin, I want to download the latest AD agent so that I can leverage the auto-update feature moving forward.</li>-->
                <li>As an admin, I want to update my agents now so that I can select specific agents and monitor their progress.</li>
                <li>
                    <div>As an admin, I want to schedule an agent auto-update for later so that the job only runs during a specific window of time.*
                    <p class="image-captions" style="margin: 12px auto; text-align: left;">* This was originally out of scope. Fortunately, supported by the user research and user testing results my research partner and I had gathered, we pushed for a comprehensive solution including taking automation to the next level by adding a scheduler.

            <p>
             More visibility into our async job flows (i.e. once an agent update job starts) was a big theme during user research. This was definitely one of the more convoluted aspects of the feature, so I paired with an engineer to design all the possible job flows depending on the admin's custom configurations, including error handling.

        <h3>User Flow 2: Scheduled Agent Auto-updates</h3>
        <b>As an admin, I want to schedule an agent auto-update for later so that the job only runs during a specific window of time.</b>
        <p>This flow received the most (enthusiastic) feedback during testing. For example, our users were delighted by the prospect of "setting and forgetting" an agent update schedule, completely removing the manual task aside from receiving status alerts. The scheduler evolved quite a bit, informed by not only user feedback but learnings as new tech constraints were discovered. Every design decision we made unveiled many technical implications. In the end, we were proud to launch something that became a hit almost instantly.</p>

This signaled to us that the expected behavior should be configurable.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Once an extremely manual process often requiring admins to log in to several different servers with different accounts to update all of their agents, individual and batched agent updates can now be initiated from the Okta admin portal. To make things even easier, admins can also configure scheduled automatic updates at a specified timed. So far, this feature has seen a ton of engagement. Just 6 months after launch, Okta has observed agent auto-updates increase by 293%! We've even had a major customer reach out with a glowing review:</p>
        <div class="quotes-large"><i>“My team is very small...The AD agent and Okta directory sequence was a huge part of our decision of going with Okta, because of the huge number of ADs we have with our customers. So auto-update was huge for us. If you start thinking of the thousands of implementations we have, nobody wants to go back thru and update those agents over time, whether it's because of security reasons... [etc.]” - Director of engineering at a SaaS company</i></div>

        
        <p>So what's next? We're hoping to build out this feature for all the different agents that Okta offers via other types of integrations, and with ever iteration, make it even more robust and scalable.
