    <h1>Moshu - Product Landing Page</h1>
    <h5>UX Design Concept Project</h5>
      <p>It has become the norm for customers to thoroughly research the product they’ll eventually buy online. Ecommerce brands today must promote a higher degree of transparency to retain the trust of their audience in a world where online shopping decisions are influenced by customer reviews. For customizable products, an additional concern is simply involving the customer throughout the production process. I saw an opportunity to design a product showcase landing page that addresses all of these challenges in an increasingly competitive landscape for online brands.</p>
<p>The inspiration behind the product advertised in this independent project came from my own wishful thinking as a child that one day, one of my drawings may come to life in the 3D form of a plush toy. This product encourages creative expression for kids in an age where toddlers learn to navigate apps even faster than their millennial parents.

  <h5>GETTING STARTED</h5>
    <h1>Understand the Users</h1>
    <p>In my quest to design a comprehensive landing page experience, I also wanted to gauge interest in the product I had in mind.</p>
        <!--<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kRjZGDnVmkWXOjARejcfgh3lV3uPJ7EittVhv9pxw8I">survey</a>-->
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>What do users like/dislike about current customized online shopping experiences?</li>
        <li>What aspects of a product landing page attract customers most?</li>
        <li>What would users want in a webapp for designing custom gifts?</li>
        <li>Are people interested in custom-made toys?</li>
    </ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="content2">
<div class="row">
<div class="container">
    <p>Through outreach on Reddit and Facebook I collected 31 surveys from people ages 18 - 64, and of these respondents 100% have purchased something online. While most data turned out as expected, I made some discoveries that  (see below).</p>
    <p>Three most popular online retailers:
    <ul>
        <li>100% have shopped online - on Amazon (100%), eBay (74%), Etsy (32%)</li>
        <li>55% of the respondents have purchased or received a custom order (such as monogrammed gifts or custom clothing), and most have had positive experiences.</li> 
    </ul>
<p>When I interviewed some users why they have not purchased custom orders online, answers, for the most part, involved either not coming across the opportunity to do so or preferring to do so in person i.e. try clothing personally. </p>

<div class="content">
<div class="row">
<div class="container">
To further explore what features users would like to see that may or may not already exist on their current preferred online shopping experiences, I also wanted to get a grasp of what might convert people to buying more custom items online.:

    <ul>
        <li>An overwhelming majority (97%) want the ability to see a preview of the item</li>
        <li>75% want tracking info on the progress and shipping of their item</li>
        <li>71% say their decision is affected by viewing customer reviews and photos</li>
        <li>And surprisingly, the majority (54%) answered that they are indifferent toward stores that serve a charitable cause</li>
    </ul>

<p>Lastly, I collected responses to gauge interest in the product itself:</p>

    <h1>The Goal</h1>
    <p>The product showcase landing page needs to gain the trust of customers and find clever ways through its storytelling, level of interaction, and transparency to drive purchases. Especially within the custom order realm (i.e. custom stuffed animals), the product landing page requires an interactive shopping experience to allow customizability and progress tracking.

<h5>THE RESEARCH</h5>
    <h1>Know the Market</h1>
    <p>I proceeded to learn more about the potential target market as well as the competition for a custom toy web app like Moshu. There are a couple similar retailers such as Build-A-Bear Workshop and Budsies Inc. However neither have created a parent and kid friendly digital solution to the custom toy-making experience. With this in mind, I also took into account that parents and kids-at-heart are not the only ones that are tech savvy and prone to use a creative web app - according to a study conducted by Common Sense Media, 72% of children ages 8 and under in the U.S. have used tablets or smartphones for media activities such as watching videos or playing games. Thus I designed the product showcase with the following personas in mind. </p>

<h5>BRANDING</h5>
<h1>Create the Look</h1>
<p></p>
<p>In order to create an inviting tone for this particular online shopping experience, I applied the following style guide. A few iterations in, the first typeface I chose were Montserrat, particularly Monserrat Bold, a friendly san-serif font that pops on the page especially in the navy blue of the headlines. For the body text I used Poppins, a sans-serif font with geometric shapes that I associated with creativity. As for the color scheme, bright pastels and subtle primary colors were a modern version of classic toy-themed color schemes  while emitting a sense of safety and trustworthiness that appeals to all ages.</p>

<h1>The Logo</h1>
<p>With a bit of<a href="images/moshu/moshu-mindmap.png" target="_blank"> mind-mapping</a> and experimenting with shapes from animals to fantastical creatures, I designed the logo as seen below.</p>

  <h5>DESIGNING THE EXPERIENCE</h5>
  <h1>User Flows and Site Map</h1>
  <p>With personas and user stories in mind, I mapped out the user flows for Moshu. In order to best understand the product being showcased, I also mapped out the full experience from onboarding to creating a new toy to finalizing the transaction. All steps were accounted for and prepped to create my first low-fidelity wireframes for Moshu.</p>

  <h1>Testing with Wireframes</h1>
  <p>Using Sketch, I designed low-fidelity wireframes for all user flows. To research the product, I created the wireframes for not only the landing page but the Design Studio on which users can design their custom plush toy. I then created a clickable prototype using InvisionApp for my first round of usability testing. The purpose of testing early is to capture any areas of improvement before diving too deep into designing. I asked five testers to comment aloud as they went through each scenario, from creating the account to designing, purchasing, and tracking their custom order.</p>

  <h1>Test Results</h1>
  <p class="bold">Scenario 1: Browse the landing page and prepare to begin your purchase.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This part was fairly straightforward. All users were able to spot and click "Creat Your Own" and/or "Get Started."</li>
    </ul>
<p class="bold">Scenario 2: Create your custom plush toy and complete your purchase.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For this task, users were able to follow the intuitive flow of the prototype to complete their toy up until the transaction complete page. While some had questions regarding the different ways to personalize the toy (i.e. choosing colors and stickers), I concluded it was due to the low-fidelity nature of the wireframes.</li>
  </ul>
<p class="bold">Scenario 3: Complete your purchase and track your custom order.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The users were able to complete their purchase successfully by following the simple flow of the web app. Users were then taken back to the Design Studio where their toy is shown in progress. Again, lack of higher fidelity images made this less obvious, however the feedback they gave included imagining more ways that they might track the toy's progress, such as tracking numbers.</li>

<h1>Designing the Mocks and Landing Page</h1>
<p>The low fidelity prototype of the web app and user testing feedback were effective pieces of research that helped me develop the functions, content, and branding of Moshu's product showcase landing page. After more rounds of user testing for the landing page mocks and several iterations for sections that received the most feedback, Moshu's landing page evolved as shown below. </p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
    <p>From the first desktop mockup to the third version and several more rounds of iteration, I experimented with differences in color, typography, layout, and content until finally achieving this skeleton for <a href="https://rendabay96.github.io/moshu/">Moshu - Product Showcase Landing Page</a>.</p>
    <p>Obvious changes include the elimination of the accordian styled mobile page. This initial design as shown in Version 3 - Mobile B was inspired by a landing page that had a lot more content for the user to sift through, and by the reactions of my users I decided it was not right for Moshu. An open, simple layout now featuring a softer, more pastel color scheme and fewer distractions reduce any barriers that block the user from the site's content and ultimately, the custom toy-making experience. Next steps include using the remainder of the research that went into what the entire shopping experience could look like for Moshu and prototyping the product itself. Stay tuned!</p>
