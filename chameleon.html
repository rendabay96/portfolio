           <h4>Internal Tool - UX/UI</h4>
           <h1>Chameleon - Multivariate Testing</h1>
           At the data science company where I work, our internal ad configuration and multivariate testing tool (called <b>Chameleon</b>) needed a major redesign for our teams to work more scalably as more partners opted into our technology. Not only had technical debt build-up led to diminishing returns when it came to developing new features, our key users were constantly battling inefficiencies while using the tool. As lead designer I owned research and design, working closely with engineers to modernize our multivariate testing tool and processes.</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    </div>
<div class="projects1">
    <div class="container">
        <h4>Getting Started</h4> 
        <h3>User Research</h3>
        To kick off discovery for this long-awaited redesign, I interviewed 12 primary users of Chameleon. This included partner integration engineers, PMs, front-end dev teams, and optimization managers - each with their own level of expertise in launching and monitoring multivariate tests (as well as navigating the tool’s shortcomings). 
        <p>
            After learning their processes, shadowing their daily workflows, and documenting their frustrations, I imported all raw interview notes into a research repository and developed a qualitative data tagging system.

    <br>
        Two of the main insights we synthesized to guide our feature recommendations were:
        <ol class="default-bullets"> 
            <li>The Search functionality has to be more robust to return results that users actually care about.</li>
            <li>To reduce errors caused by redundancy and lack of UI feedback, we should address UX improvements around configuration creation.</li>
    </div>

<div class="projects3">
    <div class="container">
        <h3>The Objective</h3>
        From a product strategy perspective, we needed to redesign Chameleon so that we can achieve two main objectives: 1) rewrite the front-end with a modern technology our engineers can own moving forward and 2) improve the UX for our key users and reduce inefficiencies in their test launching workflows. 
        <p>To achieve our objective we begin by addressing the more pressing user needs and focus on redesigning the Search functionality as well as Configuration Creation.

        <h4>DESIGNING THE EXPERIENCE</h4> 
        <h3>User Flow</h3>
        Redesigning Chameleon inevitably involved rebuilding a lot of the functionality that exists today, so to get buy-in from our stakeholders (the team leads and PM) I mapped out the primary user flows along with feature recommendations informed by our user insights above. We used Figma to share the recommendations in the context of the user flow so that the engineers can begin prioritizing.

        <h4>USER FLOW #1</h4>
        <h3>Search Configuration</h3>
       	Our user research showed that the existing search results page had many shortcomings that slowed our users down when they were searching for specific configurations.

            <li><b>List results:</b> Excessive white space limited the number of results in view at a time, especially when expanding cards for context.</li>
            <li><b>Sorting:</b> Most users desired additional sort features. The learning curve for certain sort metrics also created dependencies.</li>

            <li><b>List results:</b> A table format with row items makes scanning for information much easier; more configurations (expanded or not) are within view.</li>
            <li><b>Sorting:</b> We created additional helpful sort-by features and tooltips on hover for context.</li>

        <h3>Building + Testing</h3>
        To build our MVP our engineer and I used the Vuetify framework with ready-made Material Design components. Soon we were able to ship a functioning Search MVP for Chameleon 2.0 and test for initial user feedback. 
        <img style="border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1)" src="images/chameleon/chameleon2-search.gif">

        <br>
        <br>
        So far the new Search’s positive reception has been validating the new design. It's great to know that we’ve delivered a much more robust Search feature handling thousands of configurations serving custom treatments for our partners sites. These are some of the direct quotes from our key users on how they're adapting to the new Search design: 
        
        <div class="quotes">
            <ul>
                <li>“It’s definitely faster.”</li>
                <br>
                <li>It lived up to expectations “based on the mocks we saw.”</li>
                <br>
                <li>“This has been a pretty painless transition” so far.</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>USER FLOW #2 (Preview)</h4>
        <h3>Create New Configuration</h3>
        As mentioned, our objective was also to reduce errors caused by redundancy and lack of UI feedback. One of the major UX improvements around configuration creation we wanted to focus on was  that of assigning variants (to run multivariate tests). What’s unique about this tool is that it is not simply an A/B testing tool we’re building. Often we test 3+ variants for our partners, so theoretically, the UI must accommodate any number of variants.

<div class="splitscreen2" style="background:#ffffff;">
    <div class="six columns">
        <h3>Original Variants Page</h3>
        Here's an example of how overwhelming the current flow for setting up test variants can be. After a series of steps, the user reviews a huge matrix (requiring scrolling in both directions) just to select 4 specific variants she wants to activate for the test.

    </div>
    <div class="six columns">
        <h3>Redesigned Variants Page</h3>
        We reimagined a possible flow that would reduce cognitive load. Despite essentially reversing the original process in this new UI, majority of our users have praised its intuitivenss and the removal of unnecessary steps to achieving their user goal.

        <h4>NEXT STEPS</h4> 
        <h3>Building Out The Rest</h3>
        We’re in the midst of iterating on several new user flows to reach our objective in simplifying the overall process of setting up a multivariate test. So far, the user feedback for <b>Use Flow #1: Search</b> has been a combination of positive as well as requests for even more capabilities now that the users have had time to experiement and get a sense of its potential! 
        <p>On <b>User Flow #2: Create Configurations</b>- we'll continue to test the prototype and iterate as necessary. In general we're proud of the progress we've made thus far, and I’m looking forward to analyzing more feedback so we can build out and iterate on the rest of the feature recommendations.
