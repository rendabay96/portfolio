                    <b>Project Overview</b><p>Our internal teams have had a notoriously rocky relationship with our internal ad configuration and multivariate testing tool called <b>Chameleon</b>. In order to allow our users to work more scalably as more partners opted into our media applications, we embarked upon a complete redesign to address major user needs that had built up over time. As lead designer I owned research and design, working closely with engineers to modernize the system.</p>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        To kick off discovery for this long-awaited redesign, I interviewed 12 primary users of Chameleon. This included partner integration engineers, PMs, front-end dev teams, and optimization managers - each with their own level of expertise in launching and monitoring multivariate tests (as well as navigating the tool’s shortcomings). 
        <p>
            After learning their processes, shadowing their daily workflows, and documenting their frustrations, I imported all raw interview notes into a research repository and developed a qualitative data tagging system.

    <br>
        Two of the main insights we synthesized to guide our feature recommendations were:
        <ol class="default-bullets"> 
            <li>The Search functionality has to be more robust to return results that users actually care about.</li>
            <li>To reduce errors caused by lack of UI feedback, we should address UX improvements around configuration creation.</li>
        </ol>

<div class="projects3">
    <div class="container">
        <h3>The Objective</h3>
        With the increasing volume of multivariate tests that we run for our partners, our internal teams struggled to work scalably due to Chameleon’s shortcomings when it came to their test-launching workflows, particularly around the Search feature as well as Configuration Creation. Our goal was to redesign Chameleon to help remove pain points and dependencies preventing our teams from efficiently launching and maintaining thousands of ongoing tests.

    <div class="container">
        <h3>Designing The Experience</h3>
        Redesigning Chameleon inevitably involved rebuilding a lot of the functionality that exists today, so to get buy-in from our stakeholders (the team leads and PM) I mapped out the primary user flows along with feature recommendations informed by our user insights above. We used Figma to share the recommendations in the context of the user flow so that the engineers can begin prioritizing.

        <h3>User Flow 1: Search Configuration</h3>
       	Our user research showed that the existing search results page had many shortcomings that slowed our users down when they were searching for specific configurations.

        <h3>Original Search Page</h3>
        <p>
        Frequently mentioned user paint points around the Search functionality were as follows: 
        <ol class="default-bullets">
            <li>100% of users expressed the need for more filters. Majority were frustrated with their lack of text matches at a more granular level.</li>
            <li>There's a limited number of results in view at a time, especially when expanding cards for context.</li>
            <li>Majority of users need additional sort features. The learning curve for certain sort metrics also created dependencies.</li>

        <h3>Redesigned Search Page</h3>
        A few iterations and user testing sessions later, our solution for the filters, list results, and sorting were implemented:
       <ol class="default-bullets">
            <li>Exclusions, ability to search within JSON strings, and ability to add filters sped up filtering.</li>
            <li>A table format makes scanning for information much easier; more configurations are within view.</li>
            <li>Additional helpful sort-by features and tooltips on hover for context were added.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Building + Testing</h3>
        To build our MVP our engineer and I used the Vuetify framework with ready-made Material Design components. Soon we were able to ship a functioning Search MVP for Chameleon 2.0 and test for more user feedback. 
        <img style="border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1)" src="images/chameleon/chameleon2-search.gif">

        <br>
        <br>
        So far the new Search’s positive reception has been validating the new design. It's great to know that we’ve delivered a much more robust Search feature handling thousands of configurations serving custom treatments for our partners sites. These are some of the direct quotes from our key users on how they're adapting to the new Search design: 
        
        <div class="quotes">
            <ul>
                <li>“It’s definitely faster.”</li>
                <br>
                <li>It lived up to expectations “based on the mocks we saw.”</li>
                <br>
                <li>“This has been a pretty painless transition” so far.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>User Flow 2 (preview): Create New Configuration</h3>
        The main insight from user research informing the solution for this portion of the tool was that we need to reduce human error and inefficiencies caused by lack of UI feedback. One major UX improvement around configuration creation we wanted to focus on was that of assigning variants. This is not simply an A/B testing tool we’re building. Often we test 3+ variants for our partners, so theoretically, the UI must accommodate any number of variants.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="splitscreen1" style="align-items: flex-start;">
    <div class="split-left">
        <h3>Original Variants Page</h3>
        Here's an example of how overwhelming the current flow for setting up test variants can be. After a series of steps, the user reviews a huge matrix (requiring scrolling in both directions) just to select 4 specific variants she wants to activate for the test.
        <br>

    </div>
    <div class="split-right">
        <h3>Redesigned Variants Page</h3>
        We reimagined a possible flow that would reduce cognitive load. Despite essentially reversing the original process in this new UI, majority of our users have praised its intuitivenss and the removal of unnecessary steps to achieving their user goal.

    <div class="container">
        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        We’re in the midst of iterating on several new user flows to reach our objective in simplifying the overall process of setting up a multivariate test. So far, the user feedback for <b>Use Flow #1: Search</b> has been a combination of positive as well as requests for even more capabilities now that the users have had time to experiement and get a sense of its potential! 
        <p>On <b>User Flow #2: Create Configurations</b>- we'll continue to test the prototype and iterate as necessary. In general we're proud of the progress we've made thus far, and I’m looking forward to analyzing more feedback so we can build out and iterate on the rest of the feature recommendations.
